# KNN-Classification-for-Iris-Species

### 1. Introduction
Here, I am working on a well-known Supervised Machine Learning algorithm known as KNN or k-Nearest Neighbors.
I am using the Iris data set to build the kNN model. Iris data is a very popular data set for machine learning. Species variable is our target variable which we will predict using our model.
